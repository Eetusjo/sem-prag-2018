We have installed the *nltk* package for you in the background so just take its existence for granted. After **import** we list what pieces of data we want to import, and because the data have non-descriptive names (text1, text2), we also rename them using the **as** keyword. \n",

In the second code cell below we print out the first few of the texts to make sure we got the right data. \n",
