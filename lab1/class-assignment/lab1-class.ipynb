Functions will be explained later in this lab, so don't worry about the terminology yet, but you can probably already guess what `print` does. Inside the parentheses that follow you see double quotes. Double quotes in Python indicate strings (for now, you can think 'text'). Write your message inside the quotes and press `Ctrl + Enter` to run the code cell."

If you have never programmed before, Python with its simple and clean syntax is definitely a great way to get started."
