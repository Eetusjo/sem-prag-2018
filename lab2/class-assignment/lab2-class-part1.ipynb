    "Whenever we assign a string to some variable, we actually create a *string object* with the specified character sequence as its contents. So what's the deal with the variable now containing an object instead of just a plain old string like we have been saying all the time? An object is simply an instantiation of some pre-defined arbitrary data structure. The definition of the structure is called a class. We won't have to define our own classes, but keep the term in mind. The class is in other words a template for creating objects of the type, and it specifies what is common between all its instantiations, leaving the details to the individual objects. For example, the definition of the string class includes something about the contents being a sequence of characters, but the specific sequence is decided only when we create a string object. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the code cell above, the `split()` is actually a method of the string. A method is a special kind of function tied to some specific class, and it is called with the dot-notation (`object.method()`). The distinction between methods and functions is subtle. You might think of functions as feeding your data to some process or machine and later gathering the result of the process for your use. In the case of methods, you tell the entity containing the data what you want of it, and the entity gives you the result. There is no reason in principle why you could not implement your own `split`-function that would take as an argument a string and return a list, and use that instead of the `split`-method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we have a great example of a task we can implement both as a function and a method. In the last lab session we implemented a function `ends_with(string1, string2)` that takes two arguments and returns a `boolean` indicating whether `string1` ends with `string2`. You can find the definition below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the `ends_with` function was a good illustration, but in fact unnecessary work. The Python string class already supplies a method `endswith()` that takes one string argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the string on which we are calling the method ends with the argument string."
