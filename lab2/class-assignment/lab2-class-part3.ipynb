    "**Ex 3.1** Let's implement the algorithm one step at a time. The numbers on the right hand side of the pseudocode mark the lines corresponding to each step of this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1.** In the first two lines of our pseudocode we initialize the target word we want to disambiguate as well as the context we will use. Your first task is to initialize these two things. Use the sentence \"*time flies like an arrow*\" and disambiguate the word \"*time*\". In the code cell below, initialize a variable `target` to contain the string \"time\". Also initialize a variable `context` that contains the context words as a Python set. You can find examples of how to do this in the review section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2.** The next step in the algorithm is to go through all the senses of the target word. Remember, you can access all the senses (synsets) of the word with `wn.synsets(word)`. The function returns a list containing all the synset objects. The`for`-loop for iterating through the senses is already given. To make sure you got this right, you can print out the synset objects. The output should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Synset('time.n.01')\n",
    "    Synset('time.n.02')\n",
    "        .  .  .\n",
    "            \n",
    "**Step 3.** You now need to gather the words in the sense definition and the examples of the sense, so we can compare them to the context words. Recall the two methods of the Synset object we saw before, `definition()` and `examples()`. We have actually already extracted the words from the examples for you so what is left is the definition. We also combine the two sets of words using a method `union` offered by the set class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4.** In the fourth step you need to calculate the overlap between the context and the definition/examples. The set-class offers another convenient function, `a.intersection(b)`, that returns the set of overlapping elements of the sets `a` and `b`. After you have the set of common words, you can calculate its length using the familiar `len`-function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5.** In the final step you need to compare this overlap to the previous overlaps. For this we initialized the variables `best_sense` an `best_overlap` for you at the start of the code cell. If current overlap is greater than `best_overlap`, assign current sense to the `best_sense` variable and update the `best_overlap` variable to keep track of the best one this far. Use the supplied `if`-statement for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now uncomment the `print`-statement on the final line of the code cell to check the correctness of you algorithm. The output of the cell should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    time time.v.05 adjust so that a force is applied and an action occurs at the desired time\n",
    "    \n",
    "Feel free to play around with different target words and sentences by changing the variables `target` and `sentence`. How well does the algorithm work?"
